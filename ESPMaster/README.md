# ESPMaster Scott Version - Modifications

This is a modified version of the ESPMaster code with improvements for better web server responsiveness and debugging capabilities.

## Major Changes from the Base v2.3.0 Release

- Added LED-driven setup/debug indicators that map each initialization stage to a blink pattern for quick diagnosis in the field.
- Replaced blocking calls (notably `waitForSync()` and `delay()`) with non-blocking loops that `yield()` so the HTTP server stays responsive.
- Introduced per-phase timeouts (WiFi, NTP sync, flap updates, filesystem waits) to prevent indefinite hangs.
- Expanded debug output, including a status string that traces the current setup phase over serial and mirroring of those messages to the web UI.
- Added a WiFi strength indicator (RSSI + qualitative label) on the main interface so you can spot reception issues without attaching a serial cable.
- Hardened `ServiceFlapFunctions` with cooperative timing so lengthy display updates do not starve the rest of the system.

## Key Changes

### 1. LED Debug Codes
Added LED blink codes on GPIO 2 (configurable) to indicate system status:
- **1 blink** = WiFi connecting
- **2 blinks** = WiFi connected
- **3 blinks** = NTP syncing
- **4 blinks** = NTP sync success
- **5 blinks** = NTP sync failed
- **6 blinks** = File system init
- **7 blinks** = Web server starting
- **8 blinks** = Web server ready
- **Continuous blink** = Error/hang detected

**ESP-01 vs ESP-01S notes**
- `ESP-01` (original): the onboard blue LED is tied to GPIO 1 (TX), so leave `LED_DEBUG_PIN` on GPIO 2 and drive an external LED when using that module.
- `ESP-01S`: the blue LED is factory-wired to GPIO 2 (not TX/RX), is active LOW, and works great for the blink codes out of the box—no extra wiring needed. Keeping the default `LED_DEBUG_PIN 2` setting drives that LED while the UART pins stay dedicated to the flap-chain traffic.

### 2. Non-Blocking NTP Sync
- Replaced blocking `waitForSync()` with a non-blocking timeout-based approach
- 30-second timeout prevents indefinite hanging
- Calls `yield()` during sync to allow web server to process requests
- System continues even if NTP sync fails

### 3. Web Server Responsiveness Improvements
- Added `yield()` calls in all blocking `while` loops in `ServiceFlapFunctions.ino`
- Replaced blocking `delay()` calls with non-blocking timing using `millis()`
- Added 30-second timeouts to prevent infinite hangs when waiting for display
- Web server can now process requests even while display is updating

### 4. Enhanced Debugging
- Added `DEBUG:` status messages throughout setup
- Debug status string tracks current initialization phase
- More verbose logging for troubleshooting
- Startup progress (the same text that normally appears over serial) is now published to a lightweight `/debug-log` web page during boot so you can see the initialization phases before the UI loads.
- After the UI loads, the most recent debug lines stream into the "Debug Log" viewer at the bottom of the main web interface, making it easy to spot failures without opening the serial console.

### 5. WiFi Strength Indicator
- `getCurrentSettingValues()` now samples RSSI multiple times and returns both the raw dBm value and connection state.
- The web UI renders this as a color-coded "Excellent/Very Good/…/Very Weak" status line next to the WiFi details.
- Use this to diagnose poor placement or antenna issues; values worse than about -80 dBm usually cause missed OTA packets and unreliable message pushes.

## Hardware Requirements

- **LED Debug Pin**: GPIO 2 (default, can be changed in code)
- Connect LED between GPIO 2 and GND (with appropriate current-limiting resistor if needed)
- Note: GPIO 2 is also used for I2C on some ESP01 modules - adjust if there's a conflict

## Configuration

To change the LED pin, modify these lines in `ESPMaster.ino`:
```cpp
#define LED_DEBUG_PIN 2
#define LED_ON LOW   // ESP01 LED is typically active LOW
#define LED_OFF HIGH
```

## Version

- **Version**: 2.3.0-Scott
- **Based on**: split-flap-scientress ESPMaster v2.3.0

## Files Modified

1. **ESPMaster.ino**
   - Added LED control functions
   - Non-blocking NTP sync with timeout
   - LED blink codes throughout setup
   - Enhanced debug logging

2. **ServiceFlapFunctions.ino**
   - Added `yield()` calls in all blocking loops
   - Non-blocking delays with `yield()`
   - Timeout protection for display wait loops

## Benefits

- **Web interface remains responsive** even when display is updating
- **Visual debugging** via LED blink codes
- **No more indefinite hangs** from NTP sync or display waits
- **Better error detection** through LED patterns and debug messages

## Troubleshooting

If the web page still doesn't load:
1. Check LED blink pattern to see where initialization stops
2. Enable `SERIAL_ENABLE` to see debug messages
3. Check if NTP sync is failing (5 blinks = failed)
4. Verify WiFi connection (2 blinks = connected)

If LED doesn't work:
- Check GPIO 2 pin assignment
- Verify LED polarity (LED_ON = LOW for ESP01)
- Ensure LED has proper current-limiting resistor
